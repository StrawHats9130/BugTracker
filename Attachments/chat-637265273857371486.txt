16:05:44	 From  Trevor Popham : Check if your other websites are still live
16:05:48	 From  Allison : I'm gonna leave the group chat to go over the avatar session again. I'll be on teams still and looking at the chat here occasionally. 
16:07:58	 From  Terri : FYI the original publish walkthrough video was posted in Curriculum on May 1
16:08:45	 From  Terri : I'm going to leave here so I can watch it and follow along.
16:16:06	 From  Ben : Sandard and S0 are the selections Correct?

16:18:32	 From  craig hoffman : where do we add the firewall rule ?
16:19:42	 From  Josh Casteel : on your server
16:20:23	 From  Josh Casteel : you can access it through the blog post stuff too
16:20:36	 From  Josh Casteel : firewall rules are server wide I believe
16:20:47	 From  Terri : Do we create a new server every time we publish or if TFrid  (East US) is already displaying do I go on to the next step?
16:20:55	 From  Josh Casteel : same server
16:21:19	 From  Terri : that makes sense to me.  1 server, multiple databases
16:21:26	 From  Terri : Thanks
16:22:40	 From  Josh Casteel : stepping away while waiting for publish
16:25:27	 From  Crusher of all things Fun : we do not create a new Server only new DB's on Azure
16:26:07	 From  Trevor Popham : There was that and that if he dropped a 1000 dollar bill it literally would not be worth his time to turn around and pick it up

16:35:07	 From  Matthew Wendel : ugg deploying to IIS and SQL is not fun :(
16:37:46	 From  Brian Quinn : Matt dude, this bundler crap, i'm now experiencing why you just said screw it
16:42:55	 From  Matthew Wendel : yes
16:43:13	 From  Matthew Wendel : unless you're using a LARGE number of files, it is rather pointless.
16:43:45	 From  Matthew Wendel : i could see it's use if your site has THOUSANDS of simultaneous users. but in our use case, it is another point of failure to worry about
16:44:35	 From  Matthew Wendel : or maybe for js/css components that require a large number of files
16:44:52	 From  Matthew Wendel : where a bundler will further shrink the content vs minification
16:47:01	 From  Katie Rosario : Ethan I am posting the video now. Itâ€™s a large file. Make take a while
16:50:12	 From  Ethan Nance : Thank you. I found the one for the blog publish on Teams, but if there's any issues, I'll use your video as reference as well.
16:50:22	 From  Matthew Wendel : i'm usually always on discord if anyone needs help and sees a green dot (and i'm not playing a game ðŸ˜€) feel free to hit me up!

16:51:07	 From  Drew Russell : most of it is no big deal, but inner bicep
16:52:59	 From  Lawson Ott : smear THIS on the spot and surrounding area... won't feel any itching... be sure to wash hands real good before using the water closet though!https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Max-Strength-Pain-Relieving-Cream-2-7-oz/692263008

16:56:20	 From  Drew Russell : your live site threw an error (not sure what) but because it's the live site it doesn't display the full error
16:56:45	 From  Drew Russell : Once this is done please grab the screen, you won't be the only one to get that
16:56:52	 From  Katie Rosario : booo. iâ€™ll try to run It locally
